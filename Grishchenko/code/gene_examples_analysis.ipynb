    "# Analysis of selected genes\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected four genes based on previous analysis: HLA-DRA, CFLAR, TPT1, and RPS10\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HLA-DRA** a key gene in the MHC class II region, encodes a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alpha chain. This gene is essential for antigen presentation to T cells, playing a pivotal role in the adaptive immune response.\n",
    "- **CFLAR** also known as CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator, is involved in regulating apoptosis and immune cell function. It serves as a critical modulator of cell survival pathways, influencing the delicate balance between cell death and proliferation.\n",
    "- **TPT1** or translationally controlled tumor protein, participates in multiple cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. This gene is implicated in cancer development and progression, highlighting its significance in tumorigenesis.\n",
    "- **RPS10** a ribosomal protein S10, is a component of the ribosome essential for protein synthesis. It plays a fundamental role in translating genetic information into functional proteins, demonstrating its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis."
